# vscode-dig README

VSCode Dig is an extension that allows you to easily run dig's program analysis (https://github.com/unsat/dig) on your project's source files.

## Features

`ctrl + alt + a`, `dig` command -> runs dig on the currently open source file

`digInstall` command -> pulls the latest dig docker image

## Requirements

You must have a working docker installation that vscode's shell can access. This means your user must be a part of the docker group, or you must be running vscode as administrator/root.
